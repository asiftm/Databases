# :memo: Astra Key-Value DB + Python Demo

It includes basic operations such as insert (upsert), query by key, query all key-value pairs, and an attempted delete (note: Key-Value tables in Astra do not natively support delete mutations).

## :gear: Setup Instructions
1. Sign up using the official website [Datastax AstraDB](https://astra.datastax.com/signup)
2. Create a database using a free cloud provider and region.
3. It will take a moment to initialize a database.
4. Go to **Settings > Tokens**. Select role for example "**Database Administrator**" or "**Administrator User**" and an **Expiration** time to generate a token. Preview  permissions before generating to ensure accurate application access. Click on "**Generate Token**". **Download** or copy the secrets somewhere for future use.
5. Use **CQL Console** tab to run queries. Explore the collection, databases and features of  ***KeyValueDB***.
For example :
```
describe keyspaces; //to view all keyspaces
```
